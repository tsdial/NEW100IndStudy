<h1>Independent Study Website</h1>

<h4>I spent 20 hours learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and made this, my first website.</h4>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p id="button1" style="display:none">I am a junior New College major with a depth study in Intersectionality. 
I also have a Theatre minor. I am a member of the theatre honors society, 
Alpha Psi Omega, and the social media coordinator for URGE UA. My favorite
things to do are spend time with my partner and friends, go to the River Market,
cook, and eat. After I graduate, I hope to go to law school.</p>
